TODOTXT-NOTIFY
==============

What is it
-----------
**todotxt-notify** is a perl script for notification about [**todo.txt**][1] tasks through **notify-send**

How to use it
-------------
All that you need is:

 - clone this repo or download it and put **todo-notify.pl** in any
   place that you want.
 - change the path to your todo.sh file ($todo\_path variable).
 - add cron job for executing this script every minute/hour/day/month.
 
That's all. Thank you :)

TODO
----

 - I should make refactor for this code. (my perl skill is so low... sorry)
 - Maybe rewrite this script to pure bash.
